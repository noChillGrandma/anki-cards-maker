### 1. Define a Word Object

Create a class or data structure that represents a word. This object can contain properties such as the word itself, its translation, examples, and any other relevant metadata (like frequency rank).

```python
class Word:
    def __init__(self, word, translation, examples, rank):
        self.word = word
        self.translation = translation
        self.examples = examples
        self.rank = rank

    def update_examples(self, new_examples):
        self.examples = new_examples

    def update_translation(self, new_translation):
        self.translation = new_translation

    def __repr__(self):
        return f"Word({self.word}, {self.translation}, {self.examples}, {self.rank})"
```

### 2. Create a Storage System

Use a dictionary or a database to store these word objects. The word itself can be the key, allowing for quick access and updates.

```python
word_database = {}

def add_word(word, translation, examples, rank):
    word_database[word] = Word(word, translation, examples, rank)

def get_word(word):
    return word_database.get(word)

def update_word(word, translation=None, examples=None):
    if word in word_database:
        if translation:
            word_database[word].update_translation(translation)
        if examples:
            word_database[word].update_examples(examples)
```

### 3. Populate the Database

When you process your list of words, check if the word already exists in your database. If it does, you can skip fetching the translation and examples again.

```python
def process_word(word, rank):
    if word not in word_database:
        translation, examples = fetch_translation_and_examples(word)  # Your function to fetch data
        add_word(word, translation, examples, rank)
    else:
        # Optionally update rank or other properties if needed
        word_database[word].rank = rank
```

### 4. Handle Updates

When you update your dataset, you can simply check if the word exists in your database. If it does, you can update its properties without needing to fetch the translation and examples again.

### 5. Save and Load Data

To persist your data, consider saving your word database to a file (like JSON or a database) so that you can load it back when needed.

```python
import json

def save_database(filename):
    with open(filename, 'w') as f:
        json.dump({word: vars(obj) for word, obj in word_database.items()}, f)

def load_database(filename):
    global word_database
    with open(filename, 'r') as f:
        word_database = {word: Word(**data) for word, data in json.load(f).items()}
```

### Conclusion

By encapsulating each word as an object, you can manage translations and examples more effectively, reducing redundancy and the risk of overwriting data. This approach also makes it easier to extend functionality in the future, such as adding more properties or methods to the `Word` class. 

Feel free to adapt this structure to fit your specific needs and programming language!
